# amp-subscribe

amp-subscribe wakes up an Amp thread when something it cares about happens.

Tell Amp to watch a pull request, then move on. If CI fails, a reviewer comments, or the PR is
merged, the event returns to the same thread. Amp still has the context behind the work, so it can
notify you, investigate the change, or prepare a fix.

```text
You: Watch https://github.com/acme/widgets/pull/123 and investigate CI failures.
Amp: Subscribed this thread to acme/widgets#123.

...later, while the thread is idle...

GitHub: A check failed on acme/widgets#123.
Amp: The Linux test job failed because...
```

GitHub repositories, pull requests, and branches, plus RSS and Atom feeds, are supported today. The
bridge is designed to support other event sources, such as Slack, in the future.

## Why use it?

- **Hand work off and move on.** You do not need to keep checking a PR or wake the thread manually.
- **Keep the useful context.** Reviews and failures return to the thread that understands the work.
- **Choose how Amp responds.** It can only notify you, investigate the event, or make a local fix.
- **Watch long-running work.** A thread can follow new work in a repository, a PR, `main`, or a release branch while idle.

## Quick start

You need a running amp-subscribe bridge and its GitHub App installed on the repositories you want to
watch. To run your own bridge, see [Self-hosting](#self-hosting).

1. Install [`plugin/github-relay.ts`](plugin/github-relay.ts) as
   `.amp/plugins/github-relay.ts` for one project or
   `~/.config/amp/plugins/github-relay.ts` for every project.
2. Configure the plugin with your bridge URL and OIDC audience. These commands make the settings
   available to plugins installed in either location:

   ```sh
   printf %s https://your-bridge.example | \
     amp secrets set AMP_SUBSCRIBE_URL --user --env --data-file -
   printf %s urn:your-org:amp-subscribe | \
     amp secrets set AMP_SUBSCRIBE_AUDIENCE --user --env --data-file -
   ```

3. Run `amp orb restart-processes` to load the new environment, then run `plugins: reload` from
   Amp's command palette. You can now ask Amp:

   ```text
   Subscribe this thread to https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123.
   Investigate reviews and CI failures.
   ```

   Or watch a branch:

   ```text
   Subscribe this thread to the main branch of owner/repo.
   Notify me about pushes and CI failures.
   ```

   Or watch for new pull requests and issues in a repository:

   ```text
   Subscribe this thread to new pull requests and issues in owner/repo.
   ```

   Repository subscriptions report only newly opened pull requests and issues; later activity can
   be followed with a pull request subscription.

   Or subscribe to a feed:

   ```text
   Subscribe this thread to https://namespace-status.com/feed.atom and notify me about updates.
   ```

   Both RSS and Atom feeds are accepted. Existing entries establish the initial baseline; the
   thread wakes only for entries added or updated after subscription.

Keep the plugin filename `github-relay.ts` when upgrading. Amp includes the plugin identity in its
durable webhook URLs, so renaming it would disconnect existing subscriptions.

### Response modes

- `notify`: report what happened without changing anything.
- `investigate` (default): inspect and explain the event without changing external state.
- `implement`: make and verify local changes, but do not push without permission.

When Amp creates a PR directly with `gh pr create`, the plugin automatically watches commits,
reviews, comments, checks, merge, and close events in `investigate` mode. Explicit subscriptions
still default to every supported event. You can also ask Amp to list or remove this thread's
subscriptions.

## How it works

```text
GitHub App ──webhook──┐
                     ├──▶ amp-subscribe ──durable webhook──▶ Amp thread
RSS/Atom ───poll──────┘          ▲                                │
                                └──────── subscription ──────────┘
```

The plugin creates a durable webhook for the current Amp thread and registers what it wants to
watch. amp-subscribe verifies matching GitHub events and forwards a small event summary to that
webhook. Amp stores the event and wakes the thread even when its orb is asleep.

For feeds, the bridge polls public HTTPS URLs every five minutes by default. Set
`FEED_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` to change the interval (minimum 30 seconds). Conditional requests are
used when feeds provide ETag or Last-Modified headers.

The bridge drops queued and in-progress check lifecycle events before they consume durable webhook
capacity. The plugin immediately queues terminal failures, but routine events do not steer active
work. It debounces successful checks into one current-head summary, removes check-run/check-suite
overlap, keeps workflow summaries that cannot be safely correlated, batches review submissions with
their line comments, and queues agent-authored comment replies without steering active work. It also
suppresses stale-SHA checks and pull request body/title edits. Plugin
logs include delivery reasons, steering decisions, and cumulative received/delivered/suppressed/
batched counts.

GitHub delivery IDs are deduplicated durably by the bridge. Thread-side batching and semantic
deduplication are process-local; as with any at-least-once handler, a process loss immediately after
appending a message can still produce a duplicate when Amp retries the event.

## Self-hosting

Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), then:

```sh
mise install
mise exec -- bun install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` to set:

- At least one `AMP_ALLOWED_WORKSPACE_IDS`, `AMP_ALLOWED_PROJECT_IDS`, or `AMP_ALLOWED_USER_IDS`
  allowlist.
- `AMP_OIDC_AUDIENCE` to the audience configured in the plugin.
- `AMP_WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to the host or parent domain used by Amp durable webhooks.

Create the GitHub App with its required events and read-only permissions, and save its generated
webhook secret to `.env`:

```sh
mise run setup-github-app
```

The command asks for the public bridge origin (for example, `https://subscribe.example.com`) and
the GitHub organization that should own the app,
then opens GitHub's App Manifest flow. After creating the app, install it on the repositories you
want to watch. Leave the organization blank to create a personal app. For manual setup, see
[GitHub App setup](docs/github-app.md).

Start the bridge with:

```sh
mise exec -- bun run start
```

Use `GET /healthz` as its health check and keep `DATABASE_PATH` on persistent storage in production.

The included `fly.toml` shows one Fly.io deployment. Before deploying a copy, change its app name,
region, and OIDC audience, then create the app and set its secrets:

```sh
APP=your-amp-subscribe-app
mise exec -- flyctl apps create "$APP"
mise exec -- flyctl secrets set --app "$APP" \
  GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=... AMP_ALLOWED_WORKSPACE_IDS=...
mise exec -- flyctl deploy --remote-only --app "$APP"
```

## Security

The subscription API authenticates Amp with short-lived workload identity tokens and derives the
thread owner from the signed identity. GitHub webhooks are signature-checked, delivery IDs are
deduplicated, and outbound delivery is restricted to configured HTTPS hosts.

amp-subscribe forwards bounded event metadata, not untrusted PR titles, comments, check output,
commit messages, patches, or filenames. Amp fetches that content through its normal GitHub tools
when it investigates an event.

Feed downloads are limited to public HTTPS endpoints and 1 MiB. Forwarded feed events contain
bounded entry metadata but not descriptions or body content; the plugin treats feed titles and
linked pages as untrusted data.

## Development

```sh
mise run ci
```
